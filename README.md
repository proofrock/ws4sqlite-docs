description: Query sqlite via http - and remote clients too!
---

> *This project has now a reimplementarion in Rust, called `sqliterg`, at [**sqliterg.dev**](https://docs.sqliterg.dev). It is not a 1:1 rewrite, but I tried to fix some concepts that I feel I got wrong here; plus it's smaller, (even) faster, (even) less memory-hungry and it can be built with an embedded sqlite or using the one on the system. You should feel at home with it, anyway a [migration guide is here](https://docs.sqliterg.dev/features/migrating-from-ws4sqlite).*

> *`ws4sqlite` is **not really** deprecated, it will continue to receive libraries updates (about monthly), but probably not new features.*

# ðŸŒ± Introduction & Credits

**ws4sqlite** is a server-side application that, applied to one or more SQLite files, allows to perform SQL queries and statements on them via REST (or better, JSON over HTTP).

Possible use cases are the ones where remote access to a sqlite db is useful/needed, for example a data layer for a remote application, possibly serverless or even called from a web page (_after security considerations_ of course).

Client libraries are available, that will abstract the "raw" JSON-based communication. See [here](https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite-client-jvm) for Java/JVM, [here](https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite-client-go) for Go(lang); others will follow.

As a quick example, after launching

```bash
ws4sqlite --db mydatabase.db
```

It's possible to make a POST call to `http://localhost:12321/mydatabase`, e.g. with the following body:

```json
{
    "transaction": [
        {
            "statement": "INSERT INTO TEST_TABLE (ID, VAL, VAL2) VALUES (:id, :val, :val2)",
            "values": { "id": 1, "val": "hello", "val2": null }
        },
        {
            "query": "SELECT * FROM TEST_TABLE"
        }
    ]
}
```

Obtaining an answer of:

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "success": true,
            "rowsUpdated": 1
        },
        {
            "success": true,
            "resultSet": [
                { "ID": 1, "VAL": "hello", "VAL2": null }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
