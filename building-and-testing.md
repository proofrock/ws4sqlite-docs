# üèó Building & Testing

WS4SQlite is distributed with binaries for the major combinations of OSs and architectures, or better, the ones I can access ;-). I'm trying to do portable builds as much as possible. For these reasons, building WS4SQLite is generally not required, but it could be useful for those archs I don't have access to (hello, macos/aarch64!), and to ensure that the binary matches the sources.

### Supported platforms

These are platforms for which we'll provide binaries at the time of the release.

| OS      | Arch    | Notes                                       |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | x86-64  | Static build for cross-distro compatibility |
| Linux   | armv7hf | Static build for cross-distro compatibility |
| Windows | x86-64  |                                             |
| MacOS   | x86-64  |                                             |

If you have access to an unsupported architecture, and would like to contribute the binary, please [write me](mailto:os@germanorizzo.it)!

### Building

WS4SQLite is a Go(lang) program, that uses Go 1.17 and CGO (to compile an embedded SQLite). If you are not familiar with this, please read a guide on [compiling with CGO](https://go.dev/doc/install/gccgo); the Go toolset makes it very convenient, but there are some prerequisites.

* Go 1.17
* Make
* A compile toolchain (e.g. GCC)

I included a Make file to script the building under Linux, so if you have all the prerequisites it should be a matter of:

```
git clone https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite
cd ws4sqlite
make build
# You will find the binary in the bin/ directory.
```

For MacOS replace Line 3 with:

```bash
make build-mac
```

For Windows, instead of the step at Line 3 do:

```
cd src
go build
```

And this should be all.

### Testing

The code includes unit tests. Just cd to the source dir, and launch them.

```bash
cd src
go test -v
```
