### Concurrency (or lack thereof)

All transactions are submitted to the database in non-concurrent fashion, i.e. at a given time at most one transaction can be active. A mutex takes care of this. It's much safer, and it doesn't degrade performance (for now).

If two databases are opened on the same file (see next point) there could be concurrent accesses, so take care to set WAL etc. accordingly.

### Serve two instances of the same database file

It can be done, and it makes perfect sense (e.g expose a read only instance without authentication, and a read-write one with auth). Just specify the same file in two db configurations, and use them normally.

See FAQ #5 at the [SQLite's site](https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html), and the test case `TestTwoServesOneDb()` in the code.
